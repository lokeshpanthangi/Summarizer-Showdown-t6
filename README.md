## Overview

Battle of the LLMs is an interactive web application that allows users to compare text summarization capabilities between various language models. The application pits open-source models (like BART, Pegasus, Mixtral, etc.) against proprietary models (like GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude) in a head-to-head comparison to evaluate their summarization performance.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Paste any article or long-form text for summarization, with a sample text option available for quick testing.
- **Model Selection**: Choose from multiple open-source and proprietary language models.
- **API Integration**: Seamless integration with Hugging Face and OpenAI APIs.
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare summaries generated by different models in a clean, parallel view.
- **Quality Rating System**: Rate each summary on clarity, accuracy, and conciseness.
- **Preference Selection**: Indicate which summary you prefer overall.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View performance metrics and comparison statistics between models.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 19, Bootstrap 5.3
- **Charts**: Chart.js with react-chartjs-2
- **API Clients**: Hugging Face Inference API, OpenAI API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- API keys for Hugging Face and OpenAI (for accessing their models)
