# Battle of the LLMs - Summarizer Showdown

A web application that allows users to compare summaries generated by different language models - one open-source (via Hugging Face) and one proprietary (like OpenAI's GPT models).

## 🎯 Features

- **Model Selection**: Choose from various open-source models (BART, Pegasus, Mixtral) and proprietary models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude)
- **Text Input**: Paste your own text or use the provided sample
- **Summarization Engine**: Generate summaries using both selected models
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare summaries and rate them on clarity, accuracy, and conciseness
- **Analytics Dashboard**: View performance metrics and user preferences

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- React.js
- React Bootstrap for UI components
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Hugging Face Inference API for open-source models
- OpenAI API for proprietary models

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system
- Hugging Face API key (get it from [huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens))
- OpenAI API key (get it from [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
